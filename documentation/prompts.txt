Can you carefully analyse the current work in progress xsd schema 'XSD schema (work-in-progress)'. The schema will be applied to all Process XMLs within this Notebook. Inside source 'XSD schema (work-in-progress)-Test Results' are the test results of the schema when applied to file names contained within, i.e. File 19: BPA Object - a-Validation Object 30-32.xml - Validation Failed. Can you analyse each failure message and suggest the possible fix to resolve. Use 'the-art-of-xsd.pdf' for guidance if needed. The utlimate goal is to create one powerful XSD schema, flexible enough to handle all variations of any different Process XMLs thrown at it. So it has to general enough to handle this requirement and also specific enough to actually be useful. when suggesting the fix, be aware that the same fix with have to be backwards compatibake with all other Process XMLs. List all the resolutions into a table format for each problem under each file. Then consolidate the findings and generate a new Version of the XSD that can run against the files to text that the resolutions have worked


Follow this instruction carefully. Print out a new complete version of the required XSD document.Using 'XSD schema (work-in-progress)' XSD. Can you Incorporate the proposed improvements (in source 'XSD Schema Validation and Repair') and generate a new full version of the XSD. Important: remember to generate a new full version of the XSD!
